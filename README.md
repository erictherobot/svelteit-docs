# Svelte<em>it</em> Documentation

<a href="https://docs.svelteit.dev"><img width="100%" src="./static/Svelteit-github@3x.png"></a>

Svelteit is a minimalistic UI/UX component library for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) projects.

### Why?

Yes, there are many component libraries out there today, but we wanted our own. If you like our components, use it. If you see a problem, make a pull request or fork your own and roll with it.
